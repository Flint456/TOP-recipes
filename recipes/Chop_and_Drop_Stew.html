    <h3><strong>POWERFUL hints and tips</strong></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>For spices you can try-Italian Seasoning, Oregano, Black Pepper, Garlic Powder, and Tumeric. If you like
            spicy food you can add Paprika and Chili Powder. I usually use mostly Italian Seasoning. Just cover the
            whole top of the vegetables floating on the top with a good coat of italian seasoning and whatever other
            spices you think would taste good then stir it all up</li>
        <li>You can change up the ingredients however you like or whatever is easiest- Try putting in some sweet potatos
        </li>
        <li>You can use whatever kind of canned or dry beans or lentils you like. If you use dry beans just cook however
            long it takes but make sure they are done(most beans or lentils will be finished in an hour but some might
            take longer)</li>
        <li>If you want to make things <strong>SUPER</strong> easy you can cook the quinoa in the large pot with
            everything else. I like doing it seperate and adding the quinoa when the large pot is completely done so the
            quinoa keeps a good texture</li>
        <li>You can use rice instead of quinoa</li>
    </ul>
